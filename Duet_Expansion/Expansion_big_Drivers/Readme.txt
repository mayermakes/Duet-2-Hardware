Easier to Access pins if used with DUEX5
Bigger pads to Solder to / for 5.08mm pitch Screw Terminals

At the time of writing the Expansion Breakout was unavailable, thanks to the OSHW nature of Duet boards
this was a quick solution to make a Duet2 ethernet work with DM556 Stepper drivers.
Thanks for you commitment to Open source hardware.
